Medal work by Amruta Anmol \
\
Dataset making complete \
t1 images separated into test, train, val preop and postop respectively \
\
DataLoader complete \
\
Unet complete \
To run, call net = UnetGenerator(input_nc, output_nc, 8, ngf, norm_layer=norm_layer, use_dropout=use_dropout) \
where input_nc= no of input image channels, output_nc=no of output image channels, norm_layer=Batchnorm3d, 0.5 dropout \
\
GAN to be completed \
Training to be completed
